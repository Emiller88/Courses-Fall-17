# Lecture 4
## Weak Reaction
## Pollock
## Second Law of Thermodynamics
+ The universe is always going to disorder
+ Like Pollock's painting
### Entropy
- Molecules moving through water example
#### Entropy of Propane
- Multiple cal by Joules
- Translational
	- Moving across other molecules
- Rotational 
	- Just Spinning
#### Example Reactions involving Weak Interactions
- [ ] Gibbs free energy
- As Entropy increases, Enthalpy decreases
- Delta G is Delta H -T/\S
	- Calculated H fist then -TDeltaS
#### Gibbs Free Energy Equations
- Standard - DeltaG = DeltaH -T*DeltaS
- Use second equation to plug into 3rd equation
