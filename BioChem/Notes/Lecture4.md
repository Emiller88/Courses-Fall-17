# Lecture 4
## Weak Reaction
## Pollock
## Second Law of Thermodynamics
+ The universe is always going to disorder
+ Like Pollock's painting
### Entropy
+ Molecules moving through water example
#### Entropy of Propane
+ Multiple cal by Joules
+ Translational
	+ Moving across other molecules
+ Rotational 
	+ Just Spinning
#### Example Reactions involving Weak Interactions
+ [ ] Gibbs free energy
+ As Entropy increases, Enthalpy decreases
+ ΔG = ΔH -T\*ΔS
	+ Calculated ΔH fist then TΔS
#### Gibbs Free Energy Equations
+ Standard \- ΔG = ΔH -T\*ΔS
+ Use second equation to plug into 3rd equation
+ [ ] Know 4 Equations
#### Delta G Knobs
+ What it would be at one molar
#### Standard State
+ Build Relationships
+ [ ] Work through on my own how the ΔG vs ΔG˙
#### Egg White
+ All the covalent links break and then rebind on to each other.
#### Determination of ΔH˙ and ΔS˙
### Coupled Reactions
+ ATP has two phosphate linkages
	- Breaking the P-O-P-O-P bonds through hydrolysis
