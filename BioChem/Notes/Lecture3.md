Bring a calculator for the exam!
### Enzyme Activity is influenced by pH
+ Lysozyme digests bacteria.
+ Low pH is needed to denature proteins.
### What are the pH Buffers of Life?
+ Principle buffers are phosphate groups
### pH Equations
- [ ] Go over Strong Acid
- [ ] Go over weak acid
- [ ] Memorize Equations because they won't be given to you
+ Ka and pKa are inversely proportional
+ If titrating Henderson/halselboc
""" 
pH = pKa + log([A]/[HA])
"""
+ When adding acid assume sociometric titration not Linear.
	+ pH changes very little near the pKa
	+ Especially with weak acids
#### Phosphoric Acid
+ Has three protons that can come off
+ You want to establish a pH to avoid the next jump up in pKa
### What are buffers
+ Resist changes in pH as acid and bases are added.
+ Commonly weak acid and conjugate base.
+ Range is usually +- 1.0 pKa
+ Tris = 8.1 pKa
