# Lecture 2
## Chapter 1
+ Mostly charge-charge
### Columb's Law
F = (Kq₁q₂)/(∑r²) 
### Energy of Interaction
F = (Kq₁q₂)/(∑)∫(1/r²)dr
+ 1 cal = 4.184 joules

+ Hydrogen bonding has a fixed bond length
+ No energy sign can be negative or positive
+ Van der Waals are important
+ No water in the middle

## Chapter 2 - Water
### Properties of Water
+ High boiling point and melting point
+ High surface tension
+ Polar 
+ High dielectric constant
+ H-bond donor and acceptor
+ Potential to form 4 H-bonds per 1 water molecule
### Structure of Water
+ 104.3º between the hydrogens
+ 0.095 nm Covalent bond length
+ 0.14 nm oxygen van der Waals
+ 0.12 nm hydrogen van der Waals
#### Hydration Shells
+ Formed by water molecules when dissolving salts
#### Dielectric Constant = 8
### Ice
+ The smallest number in a closed circuit is **6**
#### Comparison of Ice and Water
+ Ice has 4 H-bonds
    + H-bond life of 10 microsec
+ Water has 2.3 H-bonds at 10ºC
    + H-bond life of 10 psec
### Osmotic Pressure
