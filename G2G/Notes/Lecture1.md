# Lecture 1
## Nucleotides
+ [ ] Learn ATCGU Structures
+ Chargaff first observed A = T and C = G
	+ Called Chargaff's rule
#### Nucleobase(NB)
+ Purines 
	+ Adenine
	+ Guanine
+ Pyrimidines
	+ Uracil
	+ Thymine
	+ Cytosine
	
#### Nucleosides(NS) 
+ Nucleobase + Pentose
+ Ribonucleosides 
	+ Adenosine
	+ Guanosine
	+ Uridine
	+ Cytidine
+ Deoxyribonucleosides
	+ Deoxyadenosine
	+ Deoxyguanosine
	+ Deoxyuridine
	+ Deoxycytidine 
#### Nucleotides
+Nucleoside + Phosphate
#### Cyclic

### Different DNA Structures
+ B form
	+ Normal
	+ Right-handed 
		+ Turn every 3.4nm
		+ 10 bp per turn
	+ Two Grooves
		+ Major
		+ Minor
+ A form
	+ In a solution with high salt or with alcohol
	+ Right-handed
		+ Turn every 2.3nm	
		+ 11 bp per turn
## Sense and Antisense
+ positive (+) is sense
+ Antisense (-) is negative
	+ mRNA of - in sense sequence
+ Sense and Antisense can be on both sides of a DNA sequence
+ The complimentary sequence to the template is identical to the coding
### Transcription 
+ Tss
	+ Only -1 and +1 there is no 0 position
+ Promoter recruits TATA which recruits other Transcription factors which then recruit RNA Polymerase
+ Promoter has -35 and -10 start points which are the *initital binding site* 
#### Ribosomes
+ Have both large and small units
#### RNA Synthesis
+ Hairpin may be necessary for termination
+ tRNA
	+ Anticodon
	+ Amino acid accepting sequence
+ Mitochondria have their own translational code for AA

### Gene expression is a totally functional protein
Folding and all
### Genome
Complete set of sequences of the genetic material of an organism
