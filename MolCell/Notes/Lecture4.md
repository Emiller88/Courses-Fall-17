# Lecture 4
## Western Blot
+ Uses antibodies to check for protein concentration. 
+ Measured in Kilodaltons.
+ The smaller the concentration the farther down it will travel
+ Gel is like a net
### Common Proteins that Antibodies Used
+ Catalase - Proxisomes
+ Cytochrome C - Mitochondria
+ Acid Phosphatase - Lysosomes
### Problem:
Lysosomes are contaminating Mitochondria samples from Density Gradient Centrifugation. 
### Solution:
Add more bands in between Mitochondria and Lysosomes. I.e adding a 1.17 and 1.13 density layers 
## siRNA
Short artificial oligio Nucleotides

cap	  	poly A Tail
5' ----AUCCUCUCC---AAA 3' mRNA
3' ----UAGGAGAGG--- 5' siRNA

+ Needs to bind to a specific sequence
	+ Must be unique to one seq
	+ The longer it is the easier it is to achieve
+ Adding a mild detergent opens up the cell membrane
+ Cell destroys double stranded RNA that forms
+ Knockdown of gene expression(NOT Knockout!)
	+ Cell may die from knockdown
	+ Cell might also compensate by over expressing other genes
### Transient Knockdown
+ siRNA
+ siRNA concentration will go down as the cell colony divides over time and the siRNAs become too few to have an effect
## shRNA
Small hairpin RNA or heteroduplex RNA
### Stable Knockdown
+ shRNA integrates into the genome and has term effects on the cell line
+ Reviewers commonly ask for researchers to use both Transient and Stable
## siRNA Screening
+ Screen using library of siRNA for most genes
+ Go into it without a hypothesis
+ Just need to be good at interpreting the data
## RNAi
Used to suppress a gene in a specific tissue
#### Phenotype
What actually shows(Got breast cancer)
#### Genotype
Actual genetic composition(BRCA1 mutation)
### How do you express it only in the eye?
+ Do not add it on to a gene (the two mixed will not be viable for either most likely)
+ Every cell has the same genotype but they have different phenotypes
+ Caused by tissue specific promoters
+ Use a tissue specific promoter
+ Add DNA with construct to express shRNA
# Membranes
On Lecture 2 pdf
#### Properties:
+ Dynamic
+ Complicated
+ Define the cell
+ Phospholipid bilayer
+ Only let's in things it wants
#### Leaflet
One layer of the bilayer
#### Micelle
+ Sphere with only one Phospholipid layer
#### Liposome
+ Phospholipid bilayer
+ Lumen(center) is hydrophilic
+ Being researched for drug delivery
## Formation of Pure Phospholipid Bilayers
- [] Figure out what this is
## Lipid Classification
### Phosphglycerides
+ Hydrophobic tail - Fatty acid
	+ Saturated - Hydrophobic
	+ Unsaturated - Plasmalogen
+ Head Group
	+ Phosphatidyl ethanolamine
	+ Phosphatidyl choline
	+ Phosphatidyl serine
	+ Phosphatidyl inositol
### Sphingolipids
- [] Recognize
+ Abundant in nervous tissue
### Steriods
+ Synthesized from cholesterol
+ Non Polar
+ Makes more rigid membrane
## Membrane Budding and Fusion
#### Exocitosis
Going out
#### Endocitosis
Going in
Creates an invagination
### Notice that the Inner cellular leaflet is the outside of the micelle
+ Blue is always touching the outside
	+ Becomes the lumen during endocitosis
+ Red is always touching cytosol
+ Blue - Exoplasmic face
+ Red - Cytosolic face
### Cell flips membrane when it goes through apoptosis
