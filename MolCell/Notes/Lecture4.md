# Lecture 4
## Western Blot
+ Uses antibodies to check for protein concentration. 
+ Measured in Kilodaltons.
+ The smaller the concentration the farther down it will travel
+ Gel is like a net
### Common Proteins that Antibodies Used
+ Catalase - Proxisomes
+ Cytochrome C - Mitochondria
+ Acid Phosphatase - Lysosomes
### Problem:
Lysosomes are contaminating Mitochondria samples from Density Gradient Centrifugation. 
### Solution:
Add more bands in between Mitochondria and Lysosomes. I.e adding a 1.17 and 1.13 density layers
