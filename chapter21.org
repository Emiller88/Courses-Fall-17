* Chapter 21
** Introduction 
*** From 1% of sunlight 2x10^11 tons of CO2 is fixed per year
*** Reverse of Gylcolsis
*** Light energy is also used to fix N2 and assimilate sulfur compounds
** General aspects of photosynthesis
*** From prokaryotes to large trees they all do photosynthesis and there are several common features   
*** Occurs in membranes
** Light and Dark reactions
*** If a cholorplast is in light but has no CO2 it will produce ATP NADPH and O2 THYLAKOID membrane NEEDED
*** Dark reactions are CO2 fixing and are not light dependant
*** Dark reactions occur in the *STROMA*
*** Water is the electron source for NADPH and ATP
    - In *Bacteria* the electron source can be H2S
*** Light must exceed 219
* Questions for Prof 
  - Logic for energy transfer?
* Chapter 21 Study Guide 
** DONE Where does photosynthesis occurs in plants and bacteria?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 22:37]
   In membranes! (of the chloroplasts)
** TODO Chloroplasts structure and function are very important.
   - The inner membrane system is called the thylakoid membranes, which are flattened discs or sacs. There are three membrane-bound aqueous regions: stroma, intermembrane space (between inner and outer membrane), and interior of thylakoid membranes (thylakoid space or lumen).
   - Chloroplasts contain DNA, RNA, and ribosomes. However, some functions are encoded by the nucleus.
** DONE What are light and dark reactions?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 22:41]
   - Illuminated Chloroplasts will generate O2, NADPH, ATP without *CO2*
     - In the /thylakoid membrane/
   - Dark Reactions can be placed in the dark and fix CO2
     - Occur in the /Stroma/
     - Uses NADPH and ATP(From the Light Reactions)
** TODO What are the products of photosynthesis and how are they made? What is the source of electrons?
   - Products
     - O_{2}
     - 2 NADPH
     - 2 H^{+}
     - x ATP
     - x H_{2}O
   - Water is the electron source.
   - Can be H2S in Bacteria
** TODO What is chlorophyll? What is its function? What does it contain (in terms of metals, and functional groups)?
   - Magnesium-containing substituted tetrapyrroles
   - Absorb light
   - Metals:
     - Magnesium
   - Long-alcohol called /phytol/
   - Fifth five-membered ring
** TODO What are fates of excited electrons?
   - Heat loss (e‚Äì goes to lower state and increases vibrational energy of environment): S2 to S1
   - Fluorescent light (at a longer, less energetic wavelength). This occurs only for saturating light.
   - Resonance energy transfer (excitation of e‚Äì of neighboring molecule). This process permits energy transfer to one reactive site (described below). An exciton is said to be transferred. S1 to S1 state. Chlorophylls must be close for this to happen.
   - Energy transduction. The more energetic molecule is a better electron donor (reducing agent). This is the transfer of light energy to chemical energy.
** DONE What is a reactive center? 
   CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 22:45]
   - There is a reactive center that contains 2 /chlorophyll a/ molecules. Most chlorophyll just transduce energy to the reactive center.
** TODO What are the two photosystems and what are their functions? What is the Z scheme?
   - PSI
     - Absorption at 700 nm
     - Does not evolve O2(Look up in book what this means)
     - Uses ferrodoxins as terminal electron acceptors in the complex
   - PSII
     - Maximal absorption at 680nm
     - Evolves O2
     - Uses quinones as terminal electron acceptors
   - Functions
     - PSI
       - Very strong reducing agent(meaning it's an *electron doner*) reduces NADP+ to NADPH(which is a strong reducing agent itself to give some reference)
     - PSII
       - Very Strong Oxidixing agent(meaning it's an *electron acceptor*)
       - Transfers electrons to PSI. This pumps electrons via the ETC which can then be used for ATP Synthesis.
** TODO What are the similarities between electron transport in oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis? What components are in common? 
   - They use an electrochemical gradient
** TODO Ferrodoxin shows up a lot. Why?
   - Iron-sulfur protein
   - Mediates electron transfer
   - Involved in both Cyclic and noncyclic photophosphorylation
** DONE What is the difference between cyclic and noncylic photophosphorylation? 
   CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 22:50]
   - Differs bescause electron comes from P700 of PSI
   - Has an additional protein /cytochrome b6/
   - Recycles an electron from PSI to /Cyt F/
   - 20 times slower than noncylic
** DONE Where are protons pumped in the process? What steps, and into what compartments?
   CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 22:51]
   - Pumped into the lumen through Cyt f
   - Pumped out to the stroma through ATP Synthase
** DONE How were chloroplasts used to demonstrate the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP synthesis? 
   CLOSED: [2018-01-29 Mon 22:51]
   - Created an artificial pH gradient that was shown to be sufficient for ATP synthesis
     - I guess they removed the hydrogen ions from the stroma 
** TODO Carbon dioxide fixation. Which reactions incorporate CO2? What are the unique reactions of the Calvin-Benson cycle? Where are ATP and NADPH used?
   - Which reactions incorporate CO2
     - Ribulose biphosphate carboxylase
       - RuBP -> 3-PG
   - ATP is used in the Phosphoglyerate kinase reaction
     - 3-PG -> BPG
   - NADPH
     - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
     - BPG -> G-3-P
** TODO What are the reactions of Rubisco? How is Rubisco activity controlled? 
   - First step of the Calvin cycle
   - Most abundant enzyme on Earth
   - Substrates
     - ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
     - CO2
   - Can also catalyze a reaction with O2
     - Products are 3PG & glycolate
   - Very slow enzyme can only fix 3-10 CO2 molecules a second
   - Responds to CO2 concentration
   - Controlling of Activity
     - High optimal pH(> 9.0)
     - Moving of H+ ions into the thylakoid causes the outside to have a high pH.
     - Mg++
     - Rubisco activase
** TODO How does light control CO2 fixation? Thioredoxin and ferrodoxin involvement is this control.
   - Light
     - Increases pH in the stroma, which in turn activates rubisco and rubisco activase and other key enzymes
     - Light increases reducing power. Thioredoxin carries e-s between reduced ferrodoxin and NADPH.
     - Increases Mg++ efflux from lumen to stroma. Activates FBPase, may be the rate limiting step in CO2 fixation.
   - Thioredoxin
     - Also reduces certain disulfide bonds in key enzymes(FBPase, SBPase, Ri-5-P kinase) this /activates/ them.
     - Thioredoxin is a small protein.
** TODO How do plants avoid the problem of the reaction of Rubisco with oxygen?
   Tropical grasses incorporate 14CO2 into malate or aspartate instead of 3PG. Malate and aspartate act as a CO2 delivery system to take CO2 from the oxygen rich surface to the oxygen-poor interior. 
** TODO How do bacteria avoid the problem of the reaction of Rubisco with oxygen? (see lecture notes, since this is not in the book)
  - Rubisco problems are low affinity for CO2, low catalytic rate, O2 as substrate
  - Carboxysomes concentrate CO2 100-1000X
  - Cytoplasmic CO2 converted to HCO3-
  - Carboxysome has carbonic anhydrase (HCO3- to CO2) and the CO2 saturates Rubisco
  - Carboxysome prevents CO2 efflux and O2 influx

** The nitrogen cycle: what are nitrate assimilation, nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification?
   - Nitrate assimilation 
     - conversion of nitrate to ammonia. It occurs in plants, some fungi, and some bacteria.
   - Nitrogen fixation 
     - conversion of N‚ÇÇ to ammonia. It occurs only in bacteria. Sometimes these bacteria associate with plants. This is an anaerobic process.
   - Nitrification 
     - Bacteria then can take the reduced nitrogen, as ammonia, and oxidize it. Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate, and use the energy released for growth. This process is called nitrification because it makes the nitrogen more readily available to plants. Nitrate is more soluble than ammonia, and plants absorb it more quickly.
   - Denitrification 
     - conversion of nitrate to N‚ÇÇ, which is released to the atmosphere. It is done by denitrifying bacteria, which are very efficient. The function of this process is to provide bacteria with an electron acceptor other than oxygen for energy generation. This is an anaerobic process. Oxygen is a preferred electron acceptor, and shuts this off in E. coli. Furthermore, oxygen interfers with this process.
** The steps of nitrate assimilation: how many electrons involved and what metals are involved? 
   - First step is a two-electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite.
     - Catalyzed by nitrate reductase
   - Second step is a six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia
     - Catalyzed by nitrite reductase
   - MoCo is a cofactor for many hydroxylase-type reactions
** What are the source of electrons? 
   - Nitrate reductase gets electrons from photosythetically reduced ferrodoxin.
** Nitrogen fixation and nitrogenase. What organisms do this? What are its requirements (reductant, energy, etc)? What are its components (the two protein components), and what do they do?
   - Only bacterial cells do Nitrogen fixation because nitrogenase is only found in them.

     - a strong reductant such as ferrodoxin
     - ATP
     - O‚ÇÇ Free conditions

   - glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
     - Catalyzes the reductive amination of ‚ç∫-ketoglutarate
       - Uses NADH as the reducing agent
     - NADPH is in excess over NADP
     - Reaction goes in the synthetic Direction because of this
     - Degradative GDHs
       - Will use NAD
         - NAD is in slight excess of NADH
       - Reaction with NAD as the cofactor degrades glutamate
       - Activated by ADP
       - Inhibited by GTP
       - Suggests its function is to provide /citric acid cycle/ intermediates for *energy*
   - glutamine synthetase (GS)

       - Makes glutamic acid AKA glutamine
     - Phosphorylates the carboxyl group
     - General theme carboxyl group will be activated before a modification
   - Pathways
     - GDH
       - Synthesizes glutamate & glutamine by the actions of GDH and GS
       - GDH has a high Km for ammonia(~2 mM in E. coli)
       - GS has a much lower Km(~0.1 mM)
       - High ammonia(not common in nature) GDH can assimilate ammonia into glutamate
       - GS can assimilate ammonia into glutamine
     - GS-glutamate synthesizes pathway
       - Occurs when ammonia is low(this is normal)
       - First synthesizes glutamine via GS from ammonia and glutamate
       - /Glutamate synthase/ uses glutamine as a nitrogen donor for the formation of glutamate
       - Difference is *ENERGY CONSUMPTION*
       - GDH does not need ATP for glutamate synthesis
       - GS-glutamate *needs* ATP
         - /E. coli/ uses 10% of the cells total energy requirements

** Principles of feedback inhibition, the covalent modification, and gene expression controls: what metabolites are involved? (I will not ask specific inhibitors, but what properties are shared by the inhibitors.) 
** What is the effect of high and low glutamine on these controls?
   - High Glutamine results in PIIA
     - interfers with phosphate transfer from NRII to NRI
       - NRI~P is a transcriptional activator
         - Unphosphorylated form is inactive
           - Gene for GS is not expressed.
